Open-Ended Project

Title: Wilderness Exploration

This will be a text based adventure akin to The Oregon Trail. The player will engage in 
simple combat encounters, manage inventory and supplies, as well as exploration. 
The goal is for the player to eventually return back to civilizaiton. Options
to save and load saves will be handled through a txt document as well. 
Classes to be included would be that of a player, item, weapon (item child),
consumable (item child), enemy, location, inventory, and a game manager to name a few.
The enemy and item classes would have subclasses as well as locations.
